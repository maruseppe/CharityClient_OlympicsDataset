# CharityClient_OlympicsDataset

Audience_Dataset: Based on historical attendance and medals of women at the past Olympics 
I aim to give a non-profit organization on women-rights the tools 
to campaign on further women attendance at the next OG, 
and to encourage political awareness on the equality gap.

Technical aspects: Iâ€™ve imported data as a local table in the databricks environment
and then started to investigate its content as in the sql file uploaded in the repository. 
Thus I've extracted csv tables on targeted historical attendance and body type within the databricks environment. 
By using pandas and sklearn libraries in python I've then carried out support vector machine regressions and classifications
to respectively fit nonlinear functions and nonlinear decision boundaries.
